This project is a program made of a well-known 3Ã—3Ã—3 cube in everyone.

As you might have expected, the cube is composed of a three-dimensional array.

But implementing this as a function is quite complicated.

Because, the rotation of the cube is a 90degree rotation transformation.

The rotation of the cube causes the color data of each piece to be transformed into a non-linear mechanism.

However, this project description will allow you to understand not only a simple implementation, but also what algorithm it is  made of.
