<h1> Cube Project ðŸŽ²ðŸ§Š </h1>

  <h3> Let's make a cube program in python! </h3>

  <h6> This project is a program made of a well-known 3Ã—3Ã—3 cube in everyone. </h6>

  <h6> As you might have expected, the cube is composed of a three-dimensional array. </h6>

  <h6> But implementing this as a function is quite complicated. </h6>

  <h6> Because, the rotation of the cube is a 90degree rotation transformation. </h6>

  <h6> The rotation of the cube causes the color data of each piece to be transformed into a non-linear mechanism. </h6>

  <h6> However, this project description will allow you to understand not only a simple implementation, but also what algorithm it is  made of. </h6>
  
  <h6> Without further ado.. </h6>
